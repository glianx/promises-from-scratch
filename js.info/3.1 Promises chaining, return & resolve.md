In a .then() chain, both return and resolve can resolve the promise, but they work differently: 
return passes a value to the next .then(), while resolve is used to manually resolve a promise.

When you use a ‎⁠.then()⁠ on a JavaScript Promise, you can either:

- **Return a value:**  
    If you simply ‎⁠return⁠ a value inside a ‎⁠.then()⁠ callback, that value becomes the resolved value for the next ‎⁠.then()⁠ in the chain.

```javascript
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then(value => {
    return value + 1; // This resolves the next .then() with 2
  })
  .then(value => {
    console.log(value); // 2
  });
```

- **Return a promise:**  
    If you ‎⁠return⁠ a new promise, the next ‎⁠.then()⁠ waits for that promise to resolve.
    
```javascript
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then(value => {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value + 1), 1000));
  })
  .then(value => {
    console.log(value); // 2 (after 1 second)
  });
```
